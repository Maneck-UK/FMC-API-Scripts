Repository for scripts written in python that interact with the Cisco Firepower Manager (FMC) API to do stuff.
I have recieved help from both collegues and strangers which assisted me in gaining the the knowledge required to write these scripts.
Thanks to you all.
In the same spirit of all the help I have received; I am making the scripts available for anyone to use.
I have used these scripts myself on a production environment firstly on FMC 6.4.x and then of 6.5.x
Please test them before they are used on another FMC environment, especially if it is a production environment.
Use of these scripts is entirely at your own risk.
